                <div class="story-content">
                    <p class="story-text">Founded in 2010 by a group of dedicated animal lovers, Paws & Claws Rescue began with a simple yet powerful goal: to rescue and rehabilitate abandoned and abused animals. Over the years, we have expanded our services to include adoption programs, educational outreach, and community events. Our journey has been marked by numerous milestones, including the rescue of over 2,000 animals and the establishment of our own shelter facility. Through the support of our volunteers, donors, and community partners, we continue to grow and evolve, always keeping the well-being of animals at the heart of everything we do.</p>
